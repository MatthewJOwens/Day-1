  <div class="bio">
    <p>I was born in Wiesbaden, Germany but only lived there for about three months before moving to America. Moved
      around
      a bit and ended up in Knoxville, Tennessee for several years. Then, my parents, little brother and sister, and I
      moved to Boise in the summer of 1996.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I finished school and went to BSU and got my Asssociate's of Applied Science in Computer Service Technology in
      December of 2006. It got me a few jobs, but it was about the time that people were starting to replace their
      computers instead of fix them because it often cost less money to do so. The only tech jobs I managed to keep for
      any length of time were call center tech support jobs. After working call centers and restaurants and not finding
      fulfilling work anywhere, I decided to go back to school for something, but I had yet to figure out what I wanted
      to
      major in.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After talking with friends and family and other people in my support network, including some web developers, I
      decided to pursue web and software dev. I looked at BSU and CWI programs as well as boot camps like Boise
      CodeWorks
      and NuCamp. I chose BCW because it was a good mix of what I want and what I feel I'll need, in a reasonable
      timeframe. But most importantly, BCW offers job placement, which someone like me, with a spotty job history,
      really
      finds useful.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I look forward to learning a lot and becoming an excellent developer in the industry.</p>
